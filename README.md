    13b. Feel free to edit the autocad file to have it only need one stand or make it be a hangable frame or something else
14. Peel and enjoy the playbutton!
    
The brand of cutter i'm using is  "Universal Lazer Systems"
Suction brand shouldn't matter as long as it vents out the plastic dust cleanly

Hope there isn't any typos here. . .
